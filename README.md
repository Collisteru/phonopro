# PhonoPro

PhonoPro is a web application created to teach The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The IPA is a standardized system of phonetic notation that represents the sounds of spoken language. Hence the purpose of the IPA is to provide a consistent and universal way to transcribe the sounds of speech across different languages and dialects. This project was created to promote and teach the IPA through two modes, spaced repetition and quizzing.

## Challenges

The difficulty in creating an educational tool is due to the balance of making it engaging and entertaining as well as informative. Implementing different modes of studying as well as giving the user a variety of options to choose from addressed this issue.

Most of the hurdles was due to scale. IPA includes a plethora of phonetics, all of which had to be scraped online and stored for reference here. This was done painstakingly but it was accomplished.
